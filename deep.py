"""
In deep.py, implement a program that prompts the user for the answer to the Great Question of Life, 
the Universe and Everything, outputting Yes if the user inputs 42 or (case-insensitively) forty-two or forty two.
 Otherwise output No.

Hints
No need to convert the user's input to an int if you check for equality with "42", a str, rather than 42, an int!
It's okay if your output or the user's wraps onto multiple lines.
